//! Ledger of shipped migrations that must never execute again.
//!
//! Migration history is immutable: a shipped version keeps its manifest entry,
//! source, and checksum forever, because every database that already ran it
//! validates that checksum on boot. When a shipped migration turns out to be
//! destructive, the only forward-compatible fix is therefore an executor-side
//! exception: the version is *recorded as applied* — same version, same
//! description, same checksum, so history stays byte-for-byte consistent — but
//! none of its steps run. A later, non-destructive migration then performs the
//! safe part of the work on every database, whether it never ran the bad
//! version or already did.
//!
//! Every entry here is a documented, one-time exception. Add to it only when a
//! shipped migration is known to destroy or corrupt data.

/// A shipped migration whose steps must not execute on any database that has
/// not applied it yet.
