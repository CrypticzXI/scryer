/**
 * A small ring showing how full one storage root is.
 *
 * This is the dashboard's only genuinely new visual primitive. The app renders
 * proportions as linear bars (`Progress`, `ActivityProgressBar`), and a row of
 * bars cannot carry a dozen roots in the space this panel has: bars need a full
 * row each, whereas a 32px ring reads at a glance next to two lines of text and
 * lets the roots wrap as tiles. It is deliberately a leaf with no logic of its
 * own: the threshold comes from the shared `usageTone` ramp and every colour is
 * an existing `--scry-*` token, so it re-tints with the theme like everything
 * else.
 *
 * Rendered as a conic gradient with the centre punched out by a `background`
 * disc, so it costs one element rather than an SVG.
